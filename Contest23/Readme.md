#Reverse String II

Difficulty: Easy

Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Restrictions:
The string consists of lower English letters only.
Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]


#Construct Binary Tree from String

Difficulty: Medium
You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.

Example:
Input: "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   / 
  3   1 5   
Note:
There will only be '(', ')', '-' and '0' ~ '9' in the input string.
An empty tree is represented by "" instead of "()"
